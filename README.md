# AllenCSF

A new webpage for Allen High School's Computer Science Forum.

## Remaking [allencs.org](https://www.allencs.org)

Started on **April 14, 2023**, this new website aspires to expand on the previous iterations of allencs.org in a style more appealing to the eye. Implementation related to this may entail:

- the addition of more pages to help navigate the forum online and stay informed
- more interactivity using JavaScript
- login features using languages such as PHP or SQL (Probably not.)
