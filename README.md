# AllenCSF
A new look for Allen High School's Computer Science Forum.
## Remaking allencs.org
Started on **April 14, 2023**, this new website expands on the previous iterations of allencs.org in a style more appealing to the eye. Implementation related to this may entail:
- the addition of more pages to help navigate the forum online and stay informed
- more interactivity using JavaScript
- login features using languages such as PHP or SQL (Probably not.)
