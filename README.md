# AllenCSF

A new webpage for Allen High School's Computer Science Forum.

## Remaking allencs.org

This new page doesn't necessarily expand on the old allencs.org, but rather reformats it to look richer and more aesthetically pleasing.

## Authors

I haven't really recruited anybody to work on this (since this was started on **April 14, 2023**), so the only person working in this repository is: 
* [me](https://github.com/mohibm708)!

## Testing

Currently, AllenCSF's appearance is tested through the CoderMerlin server [here](https://www.codermerlin.academy/users/mohibullah-meer/AllenCSF/index.html).
